# ssh-askpass-mac

ssh-askpass-mac is a graphical password prompt for OpenSSH on macOS, which can store the password in the keychain. It is executed by ssh-add when adding a private key to the ssh-agent:

It can also be used as a confirmation dialog when accessing a key in the ssh-agent:

ssh-askpass-mac was inspired by [ksshaskpass](https://github.com/KDE/ksshaskpass) and should behave like the keychain support prior macOS Sierra.
